<h2>TASK</h2>

</p>
<p>
Whenever representing the University in an official capacity, staff members will use the name of the University and its stationery. In one hundred and thirty years of existence, the University has built a reputation respected in fields of education throughout the world. It does not wish to become involved in actions with which it is not connected officially. Thus it does not permit the use of its name or the University title of any of its employees in any announcement, advertisement, publication, or report if such use in any way implies University endorsements of any product or service.
</p>
<p>
In order to use the official serviceal of the University, strict regulations have to be followed. The seal tends to be reserved for more formal usage than the official university mascot. The Marketing Communications has reproduction proofs and instruction sheets outlining proper use of both the seal and the mascot logo. This office is responsible for ensuring the correct use and integrity of the seal and the mascot logo on all University publications, supplies, materials, and equipment, whether produced by the University or an outside agency.

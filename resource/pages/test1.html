<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Whenever
representing the University in an official capacity, staff members
will use the name of the University and its stationery. In one
hundred and thirty years of existence, the University has built a
reputation respected in fields of education throughout the world. It
does not wish to become involved in actions with which it is not
connected officially. Thus it does not permit the use of its name or
the University title of any of its employees in any announcement,
advertisement, publication, or report if such use in any way implies
University endorsements of any product or service. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>	In
order to use the official seal of the University, strict regulations
have to be followed. The seal tends to be reserved for more formal
usage than the official university mascot. The Marketing
Communications has reproduction proofs and instruction sheets
outlining proper use of both the seal and the mascot logo. This
office is responsible for ensuring the correct use and integrity of
the seal and the mascot logo on all University publications,
supplies, materials, and equipment, whether produced by the
University or an outside agency. </FONT></FONT>

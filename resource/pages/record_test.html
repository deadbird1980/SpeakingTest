<B>Sound Check</B>

<P>
To begin, we would like you to do a sound check of the equipment. Wear
the handset so that the microphone is on the left-hand side. Please put
the microphone close to the side of your mouth -- about one inch away
will be fine. Whenever you are ready, press RECORD and say something
like "I am taking an oral English test and it's a really nice day
outside.  I hope this doesn't take too long."
</P>

<P>
After you stop recording, press PLAY to check if you were recorded. You
will NOT be able to play back your recordings at any other time during
the test.

<P>
If there is no problem with the equipment, you may continue with the
test. However, if there was no recording or the quality of your
recording was seriously reduced by static, try adjusting the position of
the microphone or the level of your voice, and test again. You may also
adjust the sound volume of the test, but be careful not to mute the
test. If you have any problems as you record and listen to the test,
raise your hand and wait for the test administrator to assist you.

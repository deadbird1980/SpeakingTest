<I><B>Situation 1 of 8: </B></I>A friend called you last night to ask
if you could help her out today with a difficult situation.  You
agreed, even though you have an exam scheduled for today.  You are
calling your professor to ask if you could take the exam a day late,
even though that would mean your professor would have to write
another version of the test just for you.

this test, you will see and hear descriptions of 8 different
situations before you record what you would say if you were in the
situations described.  The recording of each situation description
will be played only once.  After the recording is finished, you will
have two minutes or 120 seconds to formulate your response.  However,
you are highly encouraged to start recording your response whenever
you feel you are ready by clicking RECORD.  If you use all the
two-minute preparation time, the recording will begin automatically. 
Whenever a recording begins, you will be alerted with a prompt that
states, "RECORDING NOW".</FONT></FONT></P>

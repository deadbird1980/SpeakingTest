begin, we would like you to do a sound check of the equipment. Wear
the handset so that the microphone is on the left-hand side. Please
put the microphone close to the side of your mouth -- about one inch
away will be fine. Whenever you are ready, press RECORD and say
something like &quot;I am taking an oral English test and it’s a
really nice day outside.  I hope this doesn’t take too long.” </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>If
there is no problem with the equipment, you may continue with the
test. However, if there was no recording or the quality of your
recording was seriously reduced by static, try adjusting the position
of the microphone or the level of your voice, and test again. You may
also adjust the sound volume of the test, but be careful not to mute
the test. If you have any problems as you record and listen to the
test, raise your hand and wait for the test administrator to assist
you.</FONT></FONT></P>
